Hello, I am modifying my [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) from vim script to `lua` files, for several main reason, speed. And let's be clear I don't program in `lua`, but I can configure plugins easily and I'll create my own, so I'll hate my config.

I don't use `bspwm` anymore, I have my config of this `Tilling Manager`, but I don't use it anymore, but if you want a `bsp` config, call me on telegram : @QWE4Th
