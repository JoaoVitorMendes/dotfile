Hello, This repository is dedicated to keep my `.config` easily located and edited, I don't recommend it for those who are not used to WM, I recommend starting to use `i3`, but if you want, feel free to reuse my `config` .


I plan to upgrade as `neovim` is being configured by me gradually, so don't expect PLUGINS and advanced settings.
